Welcome to the repository of Michigan's big trees as an [interactive map](https://aidanmorales.github.io/Michigan_Big_Tree_Map/)! The map is automatically updated every month to ensure you know all of Michigan's current champion trees.

The data underlying the map is hosted by the [Michigan Botanical Society](https://michiganbotanicalsociety.org/). All coordinates are voluntary, and can be redacted at any time, so please respect the trees and rights of these landowners.
